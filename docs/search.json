    "text": "You will need to reference the slide deck on regression review to answer these questions. This deck is broken up into seven different sections. Answer the questions below (which will reference the different parts of the slide deck). Doing this will review the regression content you learned in EPSY 8251. Here are a few other resources that you can also refer to.\n\nData Codebook for the pew.csv data\nR Script for the analysis presented in the slide deck\nModeling textbook from EPSY 8251\n\n\n\nPart I: Data and Analytic Strategy\n\nWhich of the covariates will you need to create dummy variables for?\n\n\nYou will need to create dummy variables for political party. Sex (male) is already a dummy variable.\n\n\n\nRemind yourself how to create these dummy variables.\n\n\n\npew |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    democrat = if_else(party == \"Democrat\", 1, 0),\n    independent = if_else(party == \"Independent\", 1, 0),\n    republican = if_else(party == \"Republican\", 1, 0)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart II: Exploration and Relationships\n\nSlide 10 introduces output from the skim() function (available in the {skimr} package). You can see the syntax for this in the script file. The variables being summarized in the output are being selected in the line: select(age:republican, -party). Explain what this syntax does.\n\n\nThe select() function selects particular columns. In this case, it selects all of the columns between age and republican. The -party omits the party column.\n\n\n\nWhat summaries are being computed for each variable in the skim() output?\n\n\nThe following summaries are being computed for each variable in the skim() output:\n\nThe number of missing cases (n_missing)\nThe proportion of cases with data (complete_rate)\nThe mean of the Variable\nThe standard deviation of the variable\nThe minimum (p0), maximum (p100), 25th percentile (p25), 50th percentile/median (p50), and 75th percentile (p75)\nA histogram of the variable (hist)\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the relationship depicted in the scatterplot of news knowledge and news exposure.\n\n\nThe relationship between news exposure and news knowledge is a positive, linear relationship, indicating that Americans with more news exposure tend to have higher news knowledge scores. This is a fairly weak relationship (r = 0.345).\n\n\n\nIn the syntax to create the scatterplot (see the script file) the theme() layer is customizing the plot. Describe how text = element_text(size = 20) customizes this plot? What does it do? (Hint: Run the syntax with and without the theme() layer.)\n\n\nIt increases the text size to 20 points (the default size is 11 points) for all text in the plot.\n\n\n\nInterpret the correlation between Republican and news knowledge.\n\n\nThe correlation is positive indicating that Republicans have higher news knowledge scores than non-Republicans, on average. Note here that non-Republicans is the combined group of Democrats and Independents.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart III: Research Question 1\n\nRemind yourself what \\(\\epsilon_i \\overset{i.i.d.}{\\sim}\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\\) indicates. Translate this from math to words.\n\n\nThis relates to the assumptions of the model, namely that the errors are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Moreover, each distribution of errors is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and some variance (\\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\)) that is the same in all distributions. (Note: Because the variances are the same, the standard deviations should also be the same.)\n\n\n\nThe df for the F-statistic are 1 and 98. Explain why we get those values.\n\n\nThe first df value is based on the number of predictors in the model (1). The second df value is the difference between the total df (\\(n-1\\)) and the model df. Since the sample size is 100, the total df is 99 and \\(99-1=98\\).\n\n\n\nInterpret the intercept.\n\n\nThe political knowledge score for American adults who have no news exposure is 39.7, on average.\n\n\n\nInterpret the slope.\n\n\nEach 1-unit increase in news exposure is associated with a 0.33-unit increase in political knowledge, on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart IV: Research Question 2\n\nInterpret the effect of news exposure from Model 2.\n\n\nEach 1-unit increase in news exposure is associated with a 0.202-unit increase in political knowledge, on average, controlling for the set of demographic and political covariates.\n\n\n\nEvaluate the assumptions of Model 2.\n\n\n\nThere seems to be some violation of the linearity assumption.\nThe independence assumption is met since the sample was selected randomly as indicated in the codebook.\nThe normality assumption seems met as the loess smoother for the sample residuals’ density is within the confidence envelope of what we expect if the population of residuals was normally distributed.\nThe homoscedasticity assumption seems tenable as the range of the residual values seems fairly constant across the different predicted values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart VI: Research Question 3\n\nThe interpretation for the interaction effect in Model 3 was: “The effect of news exposure on political knowledge depends on education level, after controlling for the set of demographic and political covariates.” Provide an alternate interpretation of this effect. (Remember you can always interpret an interaction two ways…)\n\n\nThe effect of education level on political knowledge depends on news exposure, after controlling for the set of demographic and political covariates.\n\n\n\nBased on the interaction plot, is the interaction between news exposure and education level ordinal or disordinal? Explain.\n\n\nIt is a disordinal interaction as the lines cross within the range of news exposure values in the data.\n\n\n\nIn the interaction plot, the effect of news exposure on political knowledge (seen in the slopes) is larger for Americans with 12 years of education than it is for Americans with 16 years of eduation. In general, the effect of news exposure on political knowledge diminishes at higher levels of education. Using the plot, describe the effect of education level on political knowledge.\n\n\nHere we are looking at the vertical distances between the lines. The effect of education level is larger at low levels of news exposure than it is at high levels of news exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart VII: Tables for Publication\n\nWhere in the R output do we find the Root Mean-Square Error (RMSE) estimates?\n\n\nIt is in the sigma column of the glance() output.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart VIII: For Next Class…\n\nAnswer the questions about your computer files and your organization of those files on the final slide."

As you complete these tasks, you will not only be learning about a tool that is useful for reproducibile analytic work, but also beginning Assignment 1. As you work on this, you might want to reference different resources:\n\nChapters 1–4 of the Advanced Modeling textbook\nModeling textbook from EPSY 8251\nAssignment 1\n\n\n\nCreating a Quarto Document\n\nOpen the Assignment 1 R project (assignment-01.Rproj) you created from last class.\nCreate a new Quarto document called assignment-01.qmd and save this in your root directory. The tree for your project should now look like this:\n\n    assignment-01\n        ├── README\n        ├── assets\n        ├── assignment-01.qmd\n        ├── assignment-01.Rproj\n        ├── data\n        │   └── pew.csv\n        ├── figs\n        └── scripts \n\n\n\nUpdating the YAML\n\nIn the assignment-01.qmd file, update the title key to “Assignment 1”.\nAlso add a subtitle (“Introduction to Quarto”), author, and date key to the YAML.\n\n\n\nAdding Headings and Text\n\nAdd three Level-1 headings to your document: “Model 1”, “Figures and Tables”, and “Miscellaneous”. (Remember, headings need to have a blank line above and below them!)\nBelow the “Model 1” heading add six different Level-2 headings: “Question 1”, “Question 2”, “Question 3”, “Question 4”, “Question 5”, and “Question 6”. Below the “Figures and Tables” heading, add two Level-2 headings called “Question 7” and “Question 8”. Finally, below the “Miscellaneous” header add two Level-2 headers: “Question 9” and “Question 10”.\nSeparate each of the headings by adding some random text after each of them. Within some of the text, make some words italics and some words bold.\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Code Chunk to Load Libraries and Import Data\n\nImmediately after the YAML (after the three dashes and before your first header), skip a line and create a new R chunk. (This should be before any of the headings you created previously.) In that chunk load the {broom} and {tidyverse} libraries. Don’t forget to add a comment.\nIn the same R chunk, import the pew.csv data into an object called pew (see below). This has to be done after you load the libraries. To import the data (which you put in the data directory of your project last class) use the following syntax:\n\n\npew = read_csv(\"data/pew.csv\")\n\n\nGive this chunk a label of setup. Also be sure that the syntax in this chunk is not printed to your rendered document and that there are no warnings or messages printed.\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Code Chunk to Fit a Regression Model\n\nUnder the “Question 1” heading add a code chunk to fit the lm() that regresses news knowledge on news exposure. Be sure to give this chunk a good label.\nIn the same chunk, use tidy() to obtain the coefficient-level output. Assign this output into an object called lm1coef and print the results of lm1coef.\n\n\n\n\nUnordered (Bulleted) List\n\nUnder the “Question 2” heading, use a bulleted list to interpret the intercept and slope from the regression output. Use one bullet to interpret the intercept, and another to interpret the slope.\n\n\n\n\nAdd an Equation\n\nUnder the “Question 3” heading, use a display equation to write the fitted equation for the model you fitted that regressed news knowledge on news exposure. Be sure to use the variable names and include subscripts. Also be sure the variable names are written in normal (non-italicized) font.\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Code Chunk to Output an ANOVA Decomposition\n\nUnder the “Question 5” heading add a code chunk to output the ANOVA decomposition for Model 1 using the anova() function. Be sure to give this chunk a good label.\nUse code chunk options to hide the syntax and only print the results from anova() in the rendered document."

Place that BIB file in the assets directory of your project.\nDownload one of the APA CSL files from the Zotero Style Repository. Place that CSL file in the assets directory of your project.\nUpdate the YAML of your QMD document to include the bibliography: key.

    "text": "Welcome to EPsy 8252\nEPsy 8252 (Statistical Methods in Education II) is the second course in an entry-level, doctoral sequence for students in education. The course content for EPsy 8252 builds on the content of EPsy 8251 and includes: (1) non-linear transformations, (2) likelihood estimation and inference, (2) information criteria for model selection, (3) logistic models for analyzing dichotomous outcomes, and (4) mixed-effects models for analysis of longitudinal data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEPsy 8252 is a 3-credit course. It is expected that the academic work required of Graduate School and professional school students will exceed three hours per credit per week (see Expected Time per Course Credit Policy). In my experience, it is typical for students to spend 10–15 hours a week on this course. As with every class, some students will spend more time than that on this course, while others will spend less time than that—it all depends on your prior experiences with statistics and computing. If you find yourself consistently spending more than 20 hours a week on the course, please make an appointment to see the instructor so that we can strategize about how to best optimize how you are devoting time to the course."

    "text": "Statistical Computing\nStatistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and subsequently, EPsy 8252. To support your learning in this area, this course will emphasize the use of R. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. It should be noted that while some R syntax and programming is taught during class time, there is also a fair amount that you may need to learn on your own outside of class.\n\nDownload and install R\nDownload and install RStudio\n\nYou can install R and RStudio onto your local machine. (There are instructions for how to do this here.) You are responsible for getting things to work on your computer. While it should be straightforward, each OS and computer has their quirks. I can try to help you with this if you are having trouble.\n\n\nA Note on Inclusion and Respect\nIn this class, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful, and where every student is supported in the learning process. As a class full of diverse individuals (reflected by differences in race, culture, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, abilities, professional goals, and other social identities and life experiences) I expect that different students may need different things to support and promote their learning. The TAs and I will do everything we can to help with this, but as we only know what we know, we need you to communicate with us if things are not working for you or you need something we are not providing. I hope you all feel comfortable in helping to promote an inclusive classroom through respecting one another’s individual differences, speaking up, and challenging oppressive/problematic ideas. Finally, I look forward to learning from each of you and the experiences you bring to the class."
